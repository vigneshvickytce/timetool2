TimeTool allows you to pull task and description lists from a MySQL database.

  # Open the Options screen  
  # Select the MySQL Tab (shown at right)
  # Do not change the JDBC driver entry. MySQL is the only tested database at this time.
  # Change the Database URL to be location of your database. The format for the url is "jdbc:mysql://servername/databasename"
  # Enter the database user name in the User Name field.
  # Enter the database password in the password field. Warning: this is stored as plain text on disk.
  # Alter the SQL to return a query from your database with the following columns:
    * task_id
    * task_name
    * description_id
