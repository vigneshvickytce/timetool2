## Overview ##

This is a very simple time tracking application.

  * Add your task and clients by clicking "Add Task"
  * Click that task in the grid to start tracking time against it
  * After 8 hours have accrued, I suggest leaving work and going home

## Install ##
Download the .zip file

To run it, expand the .zip file and double click on the TimeTool Jar file (TimeTool.jar).

This requires the Java 5.0 Runtime.

    * Open /Applications/Utilities/Java/J2SE 5.0/Java Preferences.app
    * Under the "General" tab, in the "Java Application Runtime Settings", drag J2SE 5.0 to the top of the list
